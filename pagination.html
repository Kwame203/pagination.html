    Mountains are grand, prominent landforms, defined by their high elevation, steep slopes, and elevated summits, and
    are formed by geological forces like tectonic uplift, volcanism, and erosion. They are vital ecosystems, supporting
    diverse species and influencing climate, but also offer unique recreational and spiritual experiences, captivating
    humans with their beauty and challenges. Found on every continent, mountains serve as both natural powerhouses and
